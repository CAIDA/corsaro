Corsaro
=======

Corsaro is a software suite for performing large-scale analysis of trace
data. It was specifically designed to be used with passive traces captured by
darknets, but the overall structure is generic enough to be used with any type
of passive trace data.

Corsaro v1.0.0 was released on October 1, 2012.
Corsaro can be downloaded from http://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/corsaro/

Introduction
============

Corsaro allows high-speed analysis of trace data on a per-packet basis and
provides a mechanism for aggregating results based on customizable time
intervals. Trace data is read using the libtrace trace processing library, and a
high-level IO abstraction layer allows results to be transparently written to
compressed files, using threaded IO. The actual trace analysis logic is clearly
separated into a set of plugins, several of which are shipped with Corsaro.

In addition to the Core Plugins which are shipped with Corsaro, the plugin
framework makes the creation of new plugins as simple as possible. The low
overhead involved in creating a new plugin, coupled with the efficiency and
reliability of Corsaro means that it can be used both to perform ad-hoc
exploratory investigations as well as in a production context to carry out
large-scale near-realtime analysis.

Corsaro can be used both as a library and as a stand-alone application for
processing any format of trace data that libtrace supports. The Corsaro
distribution also includes several other supporting tools for basic analysis of
Corsaro output data.

Dependencies
============

Corsaro requires libtrace version 3.0.14 or higher (3.0.8 or higher can be used
if the libwandio patch included in the corsaro distribution is applied).

Usage
=====

usage: corsaro -o outfile [-i interval] [-m mode] [-n name]
          [-p plugin] [-f filter] trace_uri [trace_uri...]
       -o <outfile>  use <outfile> as a template for file names.
                      %P will be replaced with the plugin name
       -i <interval> distribution interval in seconds (default: 60)
       -m <mode>     output in 'ascii' or 'binary'. (default: ascii)
       -n <name>     monitor name (default: <hostname>)
       -p <plugin>   enable the given plugin, -p can be used 
                      multiple times (default: all)
       -f <filter>   BPF filter to apply to packets

The online Corsaro Manual, available at
http://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/corsaro/docs/, is the best source of
information about using Corsaro. It contains full API documentation, usage
instructions for the Corsaro tools. It also has tutorials about writing Corsaro
plugins and using the libcorsaro library to perform analysis on
Corsaro-generated data.
